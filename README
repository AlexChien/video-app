  Video-App is a YouTube-like site written in rails.  It converts video to flash(ffmpeg) and plays videos using FlowPlayer(an open-source flash video player).  Has Pagination(will_paginate), Tagging/Tag Cloud(acts_as_taggable_on_steroids), User Authentication(authlogic), Video Replies, and Video Thumbnails.  Video conversion is done in a seperate process, using the Spawn plugin.  Uses Rails Version 2.2.2...you can change the Rails version it uses in config/environment.rb
